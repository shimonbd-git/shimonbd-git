- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @shimonbd-git 
- ðŸ‘€ Currently CTO at WekaIO Throughout the years moved through different roles that required some sort of scripting/coding anything that was required to automate and provide new capabilities to solutions I have been working on.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently investing a lot of time learning AI/ML focusing on python since I'm working on multiple solutions with customers and partners it makes sense to experience this hands on - loving every minute of it!
